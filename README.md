# Instructions

In this exercise, you'll be implementing rules for calculating the total salary of an employee in a month.
The International Siderurgy Company (ISC) requires assistance in calculating employee salaries, considering various factors that can impact the final wage.

You have three tasks, and **you should use the ternary operator** instead of `if/else` statements to implement them.

1. Determine the salary multiplier
   - It returns the salary multiplier based on **the number of days an employee skipped work**. Apply a `15%` penalty **if the employee skipped at least five days**.
2. Calculate the bonus for products sold
3. Calculate the final salary for the employee
